**Abstract**:  
In 2021, about 82% of adults in the United States used social media platforms. Social Media is used for various purposes including information sharing, marketing, and social interaction using posts. Each post may contain hashtags that help reach out to a wider audience by
making it easier to search through the content. Hashtags create instant communities with people of similar interests. Analysing social media posts can help in several tasks such as targeted marketing. We propose a framework to generate hashtags for a given social media post using massive pre-trained language models in order to increase a post's reach.
